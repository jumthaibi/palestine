        <h1>Jerusalem</h1>
        <p>
            The largest city in historical Palestine in terms of area and<br>
            population, and the most important religiously and economically.<br>
            While the Palestinians view it as the capital of the State of <br>
            Palestine, the Israelis consider it their religious capital.<br>
            <hr>
            <h3>Location</h3>
            The city of Jerusalem is located in central Palestine, about 60<br>

            of the Dead Sea, and 250 kilometers north of the Red Sea. It is 88<br>
            kilometers west of Amman, 388 kilometers south of Beirut, and 290<br>

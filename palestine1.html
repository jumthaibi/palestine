<hr>
<p style="font-size:25px">It is the geographical region located southeast of the Mediterranean <br>
Sea up to the Jordan Valley, and in some definitions, the definition<br>
extends to include the regions east of the Jordan River, located in <br>
western Asia and connects to North Africa by its location and the <br>
Sinai Peninsula at the meeting point of the two continents, forming <br>
the southwestern part of the Levant connected to Egypt, so it was a <br>
crossing and intersection point for cultures, trade and politics in <br>
addition to its centrality in the history of religions, and therefore <br>
many of its cities have historical or religious importance, most notably <a href="Jerusalem.html">Jerusalem</a></p>
